These files were rescued when Yahoo closed down groups.
Many were created by folks I got to know on the forum.

My assumption is they would want their work shared incase other Ion/Micron/Miniak users want to use them for inspiration.

If you are one of the original authors and you DONT agree to the above - let me know and I will take down that file.
Except you did share it on a public webgroup once upon a time.
