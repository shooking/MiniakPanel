# MiniakPanel
Migrating my stuff from Sourceforge to something more modern

## BCR Presets

Presets, documentation and panels for remote controlling a Miniak via a BCR2000.
Negative NRPNs mean two controls required for some parameters.

## Manuals

User and service manuals

## Patches

User contributed patches from the defunkt Ion, Micron, Miniak group.

## Sysex Tools

Series of sysex files and decoders to:
```
1 - Generate Tables of Contents
2 - Convert to Sonar, MidiOx, Cubase
3 - Wipe system (careful!)
4 - Print out patch data
5 - Print out sequence data
6 - Print out rhythm data
```
I never got to decode multi's.

## MicronMiniakDifferences

There was a lot of debate concerning if Micron / Miniak were "better".
This folder presents the differences. So for sure - where a patch has different parameters then likely it is different.
Mostly it is the X Y Z controls that differ.
